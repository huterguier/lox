    This example shows how to reduce the loss values by taking the mean
    over the "episode" step, while keeping the other steps intact.
    Consequently the reduction is also applied to the "step" step, where 
    the mean is taken over all steps that belong to the same episode.
    There are also other reduction modes available, such as "max" or a "min".
    But note that these reduction modes can only be applied to scalar values,
    as they do not make sense for general arrays or pytrees.

      mode (str | Callable): The reduction mode to apply. Can be one of "mean", "sum", or a custom function.
      step (str): The step on which to apply the reduction. If None, the reduction is applied to all steps.
